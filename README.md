#  LUMIERE PROJECT
**Lumiere** is a web app that recommends movies based on the user's favorites. By analyzing selected films, it suggests new titles that match the user's preferences. It connects to an external movie API to fetch real-time data such as posters, genres, and ratings, making the recommendation experience dynamic and personalized.
